# Project-3-COP3530: Speedia!

Team Name: ​Gator Gearheads

Team Members: ​Emmanuel Garit, Gabriel Brosula, Boris Iliev

Project Title: ​Speedia

Problem: ​How can we recommend a specific used car to the user based on certain features, such as price point or brand?

Motivation: ​Many people are looking into buying cars, but many of those people do not want to buy a car brand new. These people want to find a used car that is fairly priced, and they may want to specify specific features of the car.

Features: ​To find the price point for a certain used car, we will use the dataset to search for cars based on the specifications provided by the user, such as registration year, mileage, and carm odel. When the program outputs a specific row from the dataset (or set of rows from the dataset), which resembles the data of a car (or set of cars), the problem will have been solved.
